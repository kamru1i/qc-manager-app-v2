# 🌟 QC Manager — Unified Office Leave Tracker & Quotes Manager

**Version 8.0.0** | A premium, modern, and high-performance desktop, web, and mobile utility built with **Next.js 16 (React 19 & TypeScript)**, **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**, **Tauri v2 (Rust Core)**, and **Capacitor v8**. It integrates two comprehensive corporate workspaces under a unified, enterprise-grade, role-based access control (RBAC) and feature flag management structure.

## Releasing

Release binaries are published to the **public** repo `bnfcorporate/qc-manager-releases`, because
this repo is private and private release assets return 404 to the unauthenticated auto-updaters.
Installed apps poll `https://chuti.bnfcorporate.com/updater/latest.json`, a URL baked into every
build that must never change.

Before tagging a release, always run `npm run version:sync` — `package.json`,
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` must carry the same version or the updater
will loop. See **[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md)** for the full procedure.

## 🚀 Workspace Ecosystem

The QC Manager consists of two primary corporate workspaces, accessible dynamically based on administrator-configured role permissions, user overrides, and global feature flags:

### 1. 📅 Leave Tracker Workspace (Chuti)

- **Sign-In / Sign-Out Panel**: One-click logging of daily attendances with customizable default shifts and live clock rendering for Bangladesh 🇧🇩 and UK 🇬🇧 timezones.
- **Live Work Hours Tracking**: Realtime calculation of daily office hours, remaining shift durations, and active break durations.
- **Leave Submissions**: Request workflows for 4 distinct leave categories:
  - **Full Leave** (Annual leave and Eid vacation days)
  - **Short Leave** (Hourly personal absences with automatic Friday Jummah 20-min adjustments)
  - **Overtime** (Logging of extra hours)
  - **Reserve Holiday** (Working on official holidays to bank leave days)
- **Government Holiday Banners**:
  - Users with reserve capabilities enabled choose between holiday pay ("Get Paid") or reserving it for future leave adjustment ("Reserve").
  - Users with reserve disabled automatically receive pay addition notifications (bypassing unnecessary screens and admin approvals).
- **Bulk Full Leave Submission**: Add up to 10 separate dates simultaneously using an interactive calendar panel. In supervisor/admin dashboards, these dates are grouped into a **single, unified action row** for one-click approval, rejection, or revision request.
- **Leave Deficit Adjustments**: Easily request adjustments using accrued overtime hours or reserve holidays to offset short leave deficits.

### 2. 📝 Quotes Manager Workspace

- **Compliance Audit Panel**: Conduct deep compliance checks on corporate document types (e.g. PDF/Excel quotes).
- **Rules & Configuration Engine**: Authorized managers and administrators create, edit, or delete compliance checking rules and view execution histories.
- **Category Checklist Selector**: Permissions specify allowed document categories (e.g. Van, Bike) per staff account.
- **Copy Helper & Admin Sales Summary**: Includes session info, sales summary, quick copy actions, detailed report, and a server-side deduplicated **Admin Sales Summary** powered by high-performance PostgreSQL RPCs.
- **Document Template Editors**: Live causality editors for EUI and Asitis formats with dynamic driver relationship filtering and Supabase template syncing.
- **Quick Import & Custom Entry**: Features bulk CSV/Excel quote importing and custom manual record entries, both protected by granular tab permissions.

---

## 🔑 Administrative Control, Governance & Security

A master control panel allows Superadmins, Admins, and Supervisors to oversee organization-wide operations securely:

### 1. Employee 360° Profile Hub & Unified Settings Form
- **Unified Profile Form (`StaffSettingsForm`)**: Standardized inline configuration layout used in both `Settings > Profile` and `User Management > User Profile Settings`.
- **Manual Department Control**: 100% manual control over staff department assignments (`Data Entry`, `IT`, etc.), completely preserving admin/user choices without automated background overwrites.
- **Standardized Form UI**: Circular checkbox inputs, smooth sliding track toggles, standardized field heights (`h-[36px]`), and dynamic 3-column inline grid for Change Password.

### 2. Granular Tab Access Control Matrix (`Settings > Access`)
Superadmins and delegated Admins can customize access levels for `User`, `Supervisor`, and `Admin` roles across 6 distinct permission categories:
1. **Main Workspace Sections**: KPI & Performance, Todos Panel, Leaderboards, Audit Logs, User Management, BD/UK Clocks.
2. **Quotes Tracker Subtabs**: Copy Helper, Save File, Monthly List, Quote Rules, Login Codes, Causality Editor, Quick Import, Custom Entry.
3. **Leave Tracker Subtabs**: My History, Govt Responses, Settlement, Leave Settings, Staff Leaves Report.
4. **Settings Subtabs**: Profile, Menu Visibility, Sanitizer, Access Matrix, Feature Flags, VPN.
5. **User Profile View Subtabs**: Leave History, Quotes History, Analytics, KPI & Performance, Profile Settings.
6. **User Profile Settings Components**:
   - `profile_component_leave_workspace` — Leave Tracker Workspace settings card
   - `profile_component_quotes_workspace` — Quotes Manager Workspace settings card
   - `profile_component_kpi_settings` — KPI & Performance Settings card
   - `profile_component_change_password` — Change Password? section

### 3. Time-Boxed Temporary Access Controls (`Settings > Access`)
- Configurable temporary overrides targeting an entire role (`user`, `supervisor`, `admin`) or a specific individual user by `Codename (Full Name)`.
- Features an intuitive **interactive DateTime picker modal** with presets (`1h`, `4h`, `8h`, `24h`, `3d`, `7d`, `30d`), single-click duration extensions, dynamic status badges, and active countdown timers.

### 4. Global Feature Flags & Per-User Overrides (`Settings > Feature Flags`)
- **Global Toggles**: Superadmins and Admins can toggle features ON/OFF globally across the entire organization. Turning OFF a feature flag immediately revokes access for all roles.
- **Per-User Overrides**: Individual user feature flag overrides (`User Management > Profile Settings > Feature Flags`) allow fine-grained per-staff feature toggles backed by database persistence.

### 5. Multi-Device Auth & Security Hardening
- **Multi-Device Concurrent Login**: Supports up to 10 simultaneous active sessions across Web, Desktop, and Mobile with local token signouts (`signOut({ scope: 'local' })`).
- **Default Password Lockout**: Users logging in with initial credentials (`1234`) are locked to a password setup modal until a custom secure password is created.
- **New Account Onboarding Timer**: 10-minute setup completion timer backed by persistent `localStorage` timestamps.
- **Security Audit Remediation**: PII protection on email lookups, atomic `jsonb_set` settings updates, strict PostgreSQL RLS policies, and RPC execution revokes.

---

## 📶 Offline-First & Realtime Architecture

- **PWA Service Worker (`sw.js`)**: Caches static web assets for offline functionality and fast loading.
- **IndexedDB Sync Storage (`offlineSync.ts`)**: Queues offline signs, sign-outs, and leaves locally, auto-syncing upon network recovery.
- **Role-Filtered Supabase Realtime Listeners**: Selective WebSocket channels prevent company-wide broadcast storms and minimize network egress.
- **System Tray & Native Auto-Updater**: Native desktop app (Tauri v2) minimizes to system tray; native desktop and Android (Capacitor) apps feature automated OTA update checking and in-app installation.

## 📜 Version History / Changelog

### 🚀 v8.0.0 — Major Release (Context-Aware Global Search, Recent Items, Continue Where You Left Off & Local-First Draft Recovery) (Current)

- **Context-Aware Global Search & Deep Navigation**: Upgraded the existing Global Search into an intelligent context-aware command and navigation layer supporting 13 core entities (Codename, Employee Name, Filename, Branch, Leave, Leave Comment, Quotation, Quotation File Type, Mistake, Date, User, Quote Rule, and Login Code) with group categorizations, deep links into tabs, filters, and entity drawers, and intentional exclusion of audit logs.
- **Global Search Recent Items**: Lightweight, client-only recent history experience when Global Search opens with an empty query, allowing rapid re-navigation to recently opened profiles, records, and settings.
- **Continue Where You Left Off**: Resilient local persistence of the user's last meaningful navigation context (active route, subtab, year/month date filters, branch selectors, and scroll positions) to immediately restore working context upon returning to the app or refreshing.
- **Local-First Draft Recovery & Unsaved Form Protection**: Comprehensive protection across all critical data-entry forms (Daily Quotation Entry, Leave Application, Quotation Mistake, Quick Import Batch, and Save File Helper) to eliminate accidental data loss from navigation, refreshes, or app closure.
- **Save File Outlook Rich Content Field Protection**: Full markup preservation for rich Outlook pastes (complex tables, borders, colors, inline CSS, layouts, and fonts) using DOMPurify sanitization, immediate onPaste synchronization, unmount flushes, and dedicated draft recovery modal previews.

### 🚀 v7.7.0 — Minor Release (Quotes Dashboard Request AbortController & Cache Pruning, Quotation Mistakes Automation & Leave Overrides)

- **Quotes Dashboard Request AbortController & Request Sequencing**: Integrated active `AbortController` and monotonic request sequence IDs (`fetchSeqRef`) into the quotations pipeline. Rapidly changing Month/Year filters immediately cancels obsolete in-flight HTTP requests, preventing race conditions and stale network responses.
- **Background Cache Pruning & Cache Optimization**: Added non-blocking background cache pruning for IndexedDB records cache, keeping local client storage lightweight and fast.
- **Optimized Date Formatting & Dhaka Timezone Caching**: Implemented memoized date-part parsing for Asia/Dhaka (`+06:00`) timezone strings, eliminating redundant parsing overhead during large dataset filtering.
- **Quotation Mistakes Automation**: Introduced smart default period computation and automated filter initialization for reliable historical mistake tracking.
- **Leave Settings & Per-User Overrides**: Added merged mode support, custom annual leave overrides, and dynamic per-user leave settings resolution.
- **Realtime Synchronization Enhancements**: Refined profile and leave update emissions in UserManagement and DashboardModals for instantaneous multi-device UI updates.

### 🚀 v7.6.4 — Patch Release (Monthly & Sale Summary Skeleton Loading Fix, Atomic Short Leave Adjustments & Requote Trigger Normalization)

- **Quotations → Monthly & Sale Summary Loading & Skeleton States**: Resolved premature 'No file records found matching the filters' and 'No sale records found matching the filters' table flash when switching month or year filters while data downloads from the database. Added synchronous loading triggers, period completion tracking (`fetchedPeriods`), and cross-tab cache sharing with in-flight request deduplication.
- **Quotations → Sale Summary Stats Skeleton Pulse**: Added smooth animated pulse placeholders for Sale Summary stat cards during remote retrieval, matching the Monthly Tab `StatsGrid` behavior.
- **Leave Management → Atomic Short Leave Adjustments**: Applied and verified `apply_leave_adjustment` and `cancel_leave_adjustment` database functions for atomic transactional consistency across Short Leave, Overtime, and General Adjustment workflows.
- **Database → Requote Insert Normalization Trigger**: Added `trg_records_normalize_file_type` trigger on `public.records` to normalize incoming `Requote Van` and `Requote Bike` records to canonical `Requote` on insertion while preserving existing historical records.
- **Timezone Boundary & Data Integrity Verification**: Standardized month-range queries on canonical Asia/Dhaka (+06:00) timezone bounds, confirming 100% record accuracy across all quotation summary tables.

### 🚀 v7.6.3 — Patch Release (Clear Approved User Requests & Fix User Deletion FK Constraint Error)

- **Settings → Users: Clear Approved User Creation Requests**: Excluded approved and rejected user creation requests from the Supervisor's active 'My Account Creation Requests' panel and badge counts while preserving complete historical request records in the database. Approved requests transition seamlessly into active profiles without lingering in the action panel.
- **User Deletion FK Constraint Fix**: Resolved `audit_logs_target_user_id_fkey` constraint violation during user account deletion. Updated `audit_business_row_change()` trigger function to safely handle foreign key references during cascade deletion while retaining actor and target identification in JSONB metadata indefinitely.
- **Audit Metadata Retention**: Updated `delete_user_by_id` RPC to write a privileged `DELETE_USER` audit log capturing actor, target codename, target role, and target user ID before removing the record from `auth.users`.
- **Realtime State Synchronization**: Integrated `user-creation-requests-updated` and `profile-updated` AppEventBus dispatches across all request transitions and account deletion pathways.

### 🚀 v7.6.2 — Patch Release (Supervisor Codename Display in Admin Approval Panel & Payload Completeness)

- **Admin Approval Panel Supervisor Codename Display**: Fixed `Manager / Supervisor` field in user creation approval cards to dynamically resolve and display the selected Supervisor's Codename (e.g. `@NS720`) in blue font-mono format with full-name tooltip, eliminating stale default to `Self`.
- **Search by Supervisor Codename in Approvals**: Extended Admin Approval Panel search to support querying by the assigned supervisor's codename and full name.
- **User Creation Request Payload Completeness**: Enhanced `CreateUserPanel` to explicitly save `assigned_supervisor_codename`, `assigned_supervisor_name`, and `assigned_supervisor_id` in `UserCreationSubmittedData` upon submission.
- **Settings → Users Pending Card Alignment**: Synchronized the supervisor display in pending request cards in `Settings → Users` to reflect the resolved supervisor codename.

### 🚀 v7.6.1 — Patch Release (Late Join Sign-Out Compensatory Offset & Settings Pending User Profiles)

- **Chuti Late Join Sign-Out Compensatory Offset**: Fixed Late Join leave duration calculation when employees work extra time past scheduled shift end. Missed arrival time is now dynamically offset by extra minutes worked after 10:30 PM (e.g. 05:20 PM in with 10:35 PM out now accurately evaluates to 04:15 instead of being stuck at 04:20), clamped cleanly at 00:00 without negative durations.
- **Early Leave Early Arrival Offset**: Enhanced Early Leave calculation to symmetrically offset early departures when employees arrive earlier than scheduled shift start.
- **Supervisor Pending Profiles in Settings → Users**: Newly submitted Supervisor user creation requests immediately appear in Settings → Users in a dimmed/pending badge state and automatically transition to active profiles upon Admin approval.

### 🚀 v7.6.0 — Minor Release (Supervisor Account Creation Workflow, Requote Normalization & Superadmin Edit Privacy)

- **Supervisor User Account Creation & Admin Approval Flow**: Restored controlled user account creation capability for Supervisors under a secure dual-phase approval flow. Supervisors submit requests (requiring `user` role and Quotes + Leave Workspace access); Admins review, approve, send back with revision feedback, or reject.
- **Optimistic Concurrency & Resubmission**: Supervisors can review admin feedback, update user details, and resubmit with automated revision version tracking and concurrency conflict detection.
- **Database RPC & RLS Security**: Backed by secure PostgreSQL functions (`submit_user_creation_request`, `review_user_creation_request`, `resubmit_user_creation_request`, `approve_user_creation_request`), strict RLS policies, and tamper-evident audit logs.
- **Quotes Requote Normalization**: Removed obsolete Requote Van and Requote Bike as new input options in Daily Entry and Quick Import while preserving 100% of historical records and reporting compatibility.
- **Quotes Workspace Category Overflow Fix**: Restructured multi-category tag display in Settings → Users to eliminate horizontal text clipping and container overflows.
- **Superadmin Leave Edit Privacy**: Eliminated user-facing Edited badge/mark when Superadmin modifies leave records, ensuring completely anonymous and untraced administrative adjustments.

### 🚀 v7.5.4 — Patch Release (Dynamic Mistakes Filters, Add Mistake Modal UI & Codename Label Cleanup)

- **Dynamic Mistakes Filter Options**: Branch, Year, and Month filters in `Quotations → Mistakes` are now derived dynamically from actual submitted records via an optimized metadata RPC (`get_available_mistake_filters`), eliminating hardcoded dropdowns.
- **Default Current Period & Graceful Empty State**: Initial load defaults to Current Year and Current Month with an intuitive empty state when no records exist, without jumping to earlier periods.
- **Viewer-Scoped Filtering & RLS**: Normal users only see filter options derived from their own accessible mistake records, while admins and supervisors maintain company-wide range.
- **Filter Consistency & Month Revalidation**: Changing the selected year automatically revalidates and resets unavailable months to All Months. Specific date selection synchronizes cleanly with Year and Month without conflicts.
- **Add Mistake Modal UI Consistency**: Standardized Branch and Codename selectors to full column width with uniform 36px field heights matching Date and Filename inputs.
- **Codename Option Cleanup**: Cleaned employee selector labels to display strictly the Codename (e.g. `AAN425`), preserving 100% underlying data integrity, user ID association, and type-ahead functionality.

### 🚀 v7.5.3 — Patch Release (Leaderboard & Navbar Rank Consistency with Yearly Tie-Breaker)

- **Yearly Tie-Breaker Ordering**: When monthly file submissions are equal, ranking now automatically evaluates yearly submissions (`overall_score`) so that users with higher yearly file counts take precedence in the leaderboard order.
- **Leaderboard & Navbar Rank Consistency**: Synchronized the server-side RPC `get_leaderboard_data` and client-side rank caching so the user rank displayed in the Leaderboard table and next to the user's name in the Navbar are 100% identical.
- **Live Cache Synchronization**: Integrated dynamic rank cache updates on monthly leaderboard evaluation, ensuring instant navbar rank alignment whenever leaderboard data loads or refreshes.

### 🚀 v7.5.2 — Patch Release (Global Leaderboard Visibility Scoping Fix & Admin Reports Subtab Alignment)

- **Global Leaderboard Scope Fix**: Resolved a client-side cross-filtering regression where `rawLeaderboardData` was filtered against RLS-scoped `profilesList`, ensuring all eligible participants across the entire company are visible to all authorized viewers.
- **Admin Reports Subtabs Alignment**: Configured Reports subtab permissions so Admins can access **Leaderboard** and **All Report** seamlessly, while keeping personal `My Report` and `KPI Report` properly disabled.
- **Workspace Boundary Integrity**: Enforced strict workspace boundaries so users with Quotes Workspace = OFF cannot access or view Reports or Leaderboard, while Admins retain administrative access to Leaderboard and All Report regardless of their personal quotes submission status.
- **Dense Ranking & Tie-Handling**: Maintained dynamic dense ranking with continuous rank positions (1, 2, 3...) and exact tie preservation across both Monthly and Yearly views.

### 🚀 v7.5.1 — Patch Release (Todo Default Working Status, Initial Status Selector & Database Alignment)

- **Default Working Status on Todo Creation**: Newly created Todo items now automatically default to `Working` upon submission, eliminating the redundant step of manually toggling status after creation.
- **Interactive Creation Status Selector**: Integrated an intuitive status selector (`Working`, `Completed`, `Idle`) directly within the creation bar, enabling optional selection before creation and resetting to `Working` after submission.
- **Database & Service Layer Hardening**: Standardized canonical `Working` default status in `todosService.createTodo` / `bulkCreateTodos` and applied migration `20260902193000_default_todo_status_working.sql` setting Postgres column default to `'Working'`.
- **Archive Logs Idle Support**: Updated historical Todo logs and badges to render the neutral circle icon and muted tag for `Idle` tasks alongside `Working` and `Completed`.
- **Compiler & Code Quality Cleanup**: Resolved React 19 compiler ref access warnings and enforced clean linting across all components.

### 🚀 v7.5.0 — Minor Release (Superadmin Trace-Free Comment Control, Read-Only Leave Comments & Hierarchical Re-Approval Flow)

- **Superadmin Trace-Free Comment Control**: Provided Superadmin with full direct visibility of stored comments and logs in edit mode, enabling seamless alterations, additions, or complete wipes with zero trace (no edit reason requirement and no forced actor attribution).
- **Read-Only Comment Locking for Roles**: Enforced read-only display of previous comments for Admins, Supervisors, and Users during leave edits, preventing tampering while ensuring historical context is fully legible.
- **Mandatory Edit Reason Appending**: Standardized the `Reason for Editing (Required)` field across all leave editing views, automatically appending newly entered reasons/remarks directly to the previous comment (`Previous Comment | New Reason`).
- **Hierarchical Re-Approval Routing**: Hardened the leave re-approval workflow so user leave modifications correctly route to their assigned Supervisor first (`pending_supervisor`), transitioning to the Admin queue (`approved_by_supervisor`) only upon supervisor approval.
- **Report Analytics Header Cleanup**: Removed redundant "Report Summary" banner from the User Profile Analytics panel (`UserAnalyticsPanel`), delivering a clean, unobstructed view of performance reports and charts.

### 🚀 v7.4.3 — Patch Release (Workspace-Based Access Control Hardening for Quotations, Chuti & Reports)

- **Target User Workspace Boundary**: Enforced target user workspace permissions (`targetUser.has_chuti_access` and `targetUser.has_quotes_access`) when Admins and Supervisors inspect user profiles, ensuring revoked workspace data remains completely hidden.
- **Independent KPI Report Visibility**: Decoupled KPI Report from the Quotes Workspace so that users with Quotes Workspace disabled can still access their KPI & Performance evaluations while Leaderboard and My Report are securely hidden.
- **Navigation & Routing Hardening**: Streamlined multi-workspace router fallback ladders across `page.tsx`, `WorkspaceSubNav`, and `UnifiedSidebar`, preventing unauthorized route landing and dead link states.
- **Zero Overhead Background Optimization**: Guarded background ranking and notification queries to skip execution when workspace access is disabled, reducing Supabase egress.

### 🚀 v7.4.2 — Patch Release (Granted Todo View Permission Decoupling & Sidebar Visibility Fix)

- **Superadmin Todo View Access Decoupling**: Decoupled granted view-only Todo access (`has_todo_access`) from generic personal feature flags and role visibility settings, ensuring the Todos tab displays immediately for granted users.
- **Sidebar Navigation Alignment**: Simplified `UnifiedSidebar` workspace checks to use `canAccessModule(profile, null, 'todo')` directly, preventing false positive tab hiding.
- **Real-Time Permission Propagation**: Ensured immediate workspace appearance and seamless navigation upon Superadmin grant without requiring full page refresh.

### 🚀 v7.4.1 — Patch Release (Todo View Access Query Optimization, Modal Stability & DNS Alignment)

- **Todo View Access Query Fix**: Streamlined `todoAccessService.getTodoAccessList()` to query direct columns without ambiguous table joins, eliminating schema cache resolution errors when opening the access modal.
- **Modal Permission Sync**: Enhanced real-time synchronization between `todo_access` records and client-side cached profiles.
- **Infrastructure & DNS Alignment**: Documented direct Anycast A-record alignment (`76.76.21.21`) for high-availability production web deployments.

### 🚀 v7.4.0 — Feature Release (Granular Todo View Access Control & Permission Hardening)

- **Granular Todo View Access**: Superadmins can now selectively grant view-only access to specific registered users via the new Todo View Access modal on the Todo workspace.
- **Read-Only Mode for Granted Users**: Authorized users can view the Daily List, browse historical All Logs, and copy task checklists without write permissions or mutation capabilities.
- **Database & RLS Hardening**: Enforced robust PostgreSQL Row Level Security policies on `todos` and `todo_access`, backed by the `sync_profile_todo_access` trigger for real-time permission sync.
- **Instant Revocation & Realtime Sync**: Immediate revocation and real-time subscription propagation ensure unauthorized sessions are terminated without stale cache bypass.

### 🚀 v7.3.2 — Patch Release (Leave Type Consistency, Soft-Delete Conflict Resolution, Multiplatform Cleanup & Vercel Sync)
